### Requirements

First you will need to install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

### Set your environment Variables

Sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io/) and generate an API key and copy your RPC url. Store it in the `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable.
NOTE: you can use other services.

Use .env file
